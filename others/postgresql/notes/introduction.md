# Introduction to PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a general purpose and object-relational database management system. PostgreSQL is free and open source software. PostgreSQL requires very minimum maintained efforts because of its stability.

## PostgreSQL feautures highlights

PostgreSQL has many advanced features that other enterprise database management systems offer, such as

- User-defined types
- Table inheritence
- Sophisticated locking mechanism
- Foreqign key referential integrity
- Views, rules, subquery
- Nested transactions(savepoints)
- Multi-version concurrency control(MVCC)
- Asynchronous replication
- NativeMicrosoft Windows Server version
- Tablespaces
- Point-in-time recovery

PostgreSQL is the first database management system that implements multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) feature, even before Oracle. The MVCC feature is known as snapshot isolation in Oracle.

PostgreSQL is a general-purpose object-relational database management system. It allows you to add custom functions developed using different programming languages such as C/C++, Java, etc.

PostgreSQL is designed to be extensible. In PostgreSQL, you can define your own data types, index types, functional languages, etc. If you donâ€™t like any part of the system, you can always develop a custom plugin to enhance it to meet your requirements e.g., adding a new optimizer.
