# Normalizing Data

Another way to make a database more flexible and robust is to 'normalize' it. Normalization makes the database more able to accommodate changes in the structure of the data. It also protects the database against certain kinds of errors.

## What Is Normalization?

Depending on how you design a relational database, it may be susceptible to all sorts of problems:

- It may contain lots of duplicated data. This not only wastes space but it also makes updating all of those duplicated values a time-consuming chore.
- It may incorrectly associate two unrelated pieces of data so you cannot delete one without deleting the other.
- It may require a piece of data that shouldn't exist in order to represent another piece of data that should exist.
- It may limit the number of values that you can enter for what should be a multi-valued piece of data.

Normalization is a process of rearranging the database to put it into a standard (normal) form that prevents these kinds of anomalies.

These are seven different levels of normalization. Each level includes those before it.

The different levels of normalization in order from weakest to strongest are:
❑ First Normal Form (1NF)
❑ Second Normal Form (2NF)
❑ Third Normal Form (3NF)
❑ Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
❑ Fourth Normal Form (4NF)
❑ Fifth Normal Form (5NF)
❑ Domain/Key Normal Form (DKNF)
