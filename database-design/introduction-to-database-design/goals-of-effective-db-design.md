A database won't do you much good if you can't get data out of it quickly, reliably and consistently.It won't be useful if it's full of incorrect and/or contradictory data. You can address all of these potential problems by using modern database tools, a good database design and a pinch of common sense.

- Why a good database design is important
- Strenghts and weaknesses of different kinds of information containers that can act as databases
- How computerized databases can benefit from thise strengths and avoid those weaknesses
- How good database design helps achieve database goals
- What CRUD and ACID are, and why they are relevant to database design

Few parts of an application's design are as critical as the database's design. The database is the repository of the information that the rest of the application manages and displays to the users.

Poor database design can lead to these and other annoying and potentially expensive scenarios. A good design creates a solid foundaition on which you can build the rest of the application.

## Information Containers

A database is a tool that stores data, and lets you create, read, update and delete data in some manner. An atomic transaction is a possibly complex series of actions that is considered as a single operation by those who are not involved directly in performing the transaction.
